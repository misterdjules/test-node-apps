# What is it?

test-node-apps is a very basic tool to automate testing of some Node.js apps against a given version of Node.js.

# How to use it?

Simply run:
```
node index.js
```
and it will output the result of the tests suite included in each tested Node.js app with the TAP format.

Currently, the list of Node.js apps to test is hardcoded in the source.
